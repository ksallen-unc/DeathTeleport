# DeathTeleport
Minecraft 1.16 plugin, Allows user to teleport to location of death. 
Honstly not the most useful on its own, is mainly nice in combination with testing other plugins. 
Made this to both gain familiarity with writing Minecraft plugins in general, as well as with the Forge and Bukkit libraries.

Use/command: /dback returns user to locaiton of death. Death must have occured since plugin was enabled -- i.e., deaths not logged when plugin disabled, so even if plugin is enabled when command entered might not be possible to return to death location based on when player's death happened.
